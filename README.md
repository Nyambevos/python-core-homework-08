This program processes a list of users, grouping their names by the weekdays on which their birthdays fall. It utilizes the current date and various functions from the datetime module. The main steps of the program include defining target days for the upcoming week, adjusting birthdates, considering weekends, and grouping names by weekdays. The result is a dictionary where keys represent weekdays, and values are lists of user names.
